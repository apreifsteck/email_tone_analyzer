To whom it may concern,

I am quite upset that the blender I bought only two days ago has broken catestrophically.
Although it did work quite well, and blended my smoothie evenlly and fully.
Blender parts went flying everywhere, nearly killing me and destroying my sense of safety.
I need compensation! Pay me back for what was taken from me! RECOMPENSE!! RECOMPENSE!!

Pay up or die,
your faithful customer
