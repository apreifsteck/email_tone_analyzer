  "text": "Hey Judy, I just wanted to thank you for the riverside cabin that you lent me for the weekend; it was magical. Each day featured new and amazing activities, and I especially enjoyed kayaking. I haven't been this relaxes in years. The only thing I didn't like was some of the wildlife creeping inside. I hate spiders. Regardless, thanks again!"
