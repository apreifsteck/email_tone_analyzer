  "text": "Hi Bob, I recently stayed at your lovely home in the heart of city center. The included breakfast was wonderful and the waffles were so tasty! The only concern I had were the creepy neighbors. They constantly were on our porch and would never leave us alone. It was kind of scary. Other than that, we had a great time! Thank you for your hospitality."
